# Decision Log

Why things are the way they are — including the alternatives that were rejected, and the
occasions when we were wrong and changed our minds.

**Where this fits.** Four documents, deliberately non-overlapping:

| Document | Answers |
|---|---|
| [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) | *What the system is* — the current specification |
| [`research/LITERATURE-REVIEW.md`](research/LITERATURE-REVIEW.md) | *What the evidence says* |
| **`DECISIONS.md`** (this file) | *Why we chose this over that*, and what we rejected |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | *What will bite you* — operational gotchas |

**Rules.** Append-only; never rewrite an entry. If a decision is reversed, add a new entry
and mark the old one `SUPERSEDED BY Dxxx` — the reversal is the valuable part. Record
rejected options with the reason, because "did we consider X?" is the most common question
a future reader will have. Keep entries short; link out rather than restating.

### D001
**Unity, not Unreal or Godot** · 2026-08-02

The bottleneck in this project is iteration speed on *simulation logic* — fitness
functions, mutation operators and sensor layouts get rewritten dozens of times — not
rendering fidelity. C# hot-iteration beats C++ recompiles for that.

**Rejected:** *Unreal* — better default visuals and Chaos physics, but every simulation edit
pays a compile cost, and Nanite/Lumen solve problems this project doesn't have. *Godot* —
tiny and fast to start, but weaker 3D physics and a much smaller ecosystem for this work.

Later corroborated rather than merely asserted: [L21 Table 2, p.15] shows PhysX used for
Lessin et al.'s rigid-body evolved creatures and Unity ML for Pathak et al. 2019.

### D002
**Co-evolve morphology *and* control (Karl Sims lineage)** · 2026-08-02

Chosen over three alternatives after an explicit comparison: neural brains on fixed bodies,
ecology/population-genetics simulation, and a player-shaped sandbox. Selected because
evolved *bodies* are the visually spectacular outcome, which was the stated primary goal.

**Known cost, accepted deliberately:** this is by far the most computationally expensive
option, and the one with the worst-documented failure mode ([D004](#d004)).

---

### D003
**Water before land** · 2026-08-02

On land the first thing a GA discovers is that the highest-scoring "locomotion" is to build
a tall tower and fall over. Water has no ground-contact instability, no falling, and a
trivial force model.

Argued from reasoning first, then supported: [C18 §3.3, pp.22–27] found land→water
transitions **detrimental** (p<0.01) while water→land trended beneficial. Their explanation
matches ours — on land, early creatures cannot overcome static friction and score zero,
so there is no gradient to climb.

**Honesty caveat:** the water→land benefit was **not statistically significant** (p>0.05).
Enough to justify the ordering; not enough to claim as a result.

### D004
**MAP-Elites, not a plain GA** · 2026-08-02

Co-evolving body and brain converges prematurely: a morphological mutation invalidates the
co-adapted controller, selection discards the offspring even when the body is better, and
morphology stagnates while controllers keep improving. [EA23] benchmarked five algorithms;
the no-diversity-protection baseline **lost every pairwise comparison**.

MAP-Elites cells also *are* morphological innovation protection — a novel body competes only
within its own cell, never against the global champion.

**Rejected:** *plain GA* — the losing baseline. *MNSLC* — won [EA23]'s formal comparison
6–5, but their own practical recommendation for virtual creatures was MAP-Elites, for its
exploration/exploitation balance. Revisit if Milestone 3 shows stagnation.

**Two corrections applied:** selection is fitness-proportional, not uniform; descriptors are
multi-BC (aligned *and* unaligned), because [K12 §4, p.11] showed aligned-only losing to
plain fitness search, and Pugh et al. warn unaligned-only can fail to reach viable solutions.

### D005
**Recursive graph encoding, not CPPN** · 2026-08-02

Looked like the most expensive decision to retrofit, and CPPNs initially looked stronger —
[EA23] used them and cited better evolvability through regular patterns.

[L21 Table 6, p.18] aggregates every published encoding comparison and the result splits by
**phenotype type**: CPPNs win on *soft bodies*; on *rigid articulated bodies* — our
substrate — direct and recursive encodings win or tie, including in the most recent
four-way comparison (Veenstra & Glette 2020). The apparent threat was a substrate mismatch.

**Also corrected a mislabel:** this encoding is *indirect*, not direct. [L21 §4.2, p.8]
classifies Sims as "an indirect representation that supports recursive structures."
Recursion, reflection and cumulative subtree transforms **are** generative machinery, so the
regularity CPPNs were wanted for is already present.

**Revisit if** the project ever moves to soft-body phenotypes.

---

### D006
**`ArticulationBody`, not `Rigidbody` + `ConfigurableJoint`** · 2026-08-02

Creatures are articulated kinematic trees, which is what PhysX articulations exist for.
Configurable joints develop rubber-band jitter under high torque that a GA will immediately
discover and exploit as "locomotion."

Stability was well-founded; **scale was not, and was the top open risk**. Settled by
measurement — see [Spike 01](spikes/01-articulation-body/) and [D010](#d010).

---

### D007
**Effectors: torque, mass-scaled, temporally smoothed** · 2026-08-02

Originally framed as a binary between raw torque (faithful to Sims, but produces buzzing
high-frequency motion the GA loves and viewers dislike) and PD position targets (smooth, but
more tuning and state).

[K12 §2.2, p.5] supplies a cheaper third option: clamp to [-1,1], scale by the mass of the
**smaller** of the two connected bodies, then average over the previous **10** values. The
mass scaling prevents arbitrarily powerful tiny motors; the smoothing suppresses the buzzing
that motivated PD in the first place.

### D008
**The farm and the theatre are separate programs** · 2026-08-02

Evaluation is headless, ugly and fast; presentation is slow, beautiful, and replays stored
genomes. They share a serialization format and nothing else.

Conflating them is the classic failure mode of this genre — it makes the search too slow to
succeed *and* the visuals too constrained to be lovely. Named explicitly because it is the
easiest principle here to violate by accident.

---

### D009
**Spike the physics before doing more research** · 2026-08-02

At the point where four of six research questions were answered, the remaining unknowns
split into two kinds. Literature gaps are questions *someone has already written down an
answer to*. Whether Unity can build and destroy articulated hierarchies hundreds of times a
second is not — no paper answers it, and it stays open regardless of how much you read.

It was also the risk that invalidated the most downstream work if it failed.

**Rejected:** finishing the reading first — the remaining papers were more likely to confirm
than overturn, and further reading has low marginal value without implementation feedback.

---

### D010
**Pooling rejected — rebuild articulations per evaluation** · 2026-08-02

[`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md) §11.1 planned a pool of pre-allocated articulations as a fallback
in case teardown proved expensive. Spike 01 measured build+teardown at **0.335 ms** against
a 15 ms budget and a ~2.4 s evaluation batch.

Pooling is therefore unnecessary — and its awkward consequence disappears with it. A pool
would have had to be **bucketed by topology** (joint limits and drive targets are
reconfigurable at runtime; tree topology is not), which would have constrained how freely
morphology could vary within a batch. Rebuilding leaves morphology unconstrained.

### D011
**Island model demoted from throughput necessity to evolutionary choice** · 2026-08-02

The design assumed ~10–12 worker processes were needed to reach 500–2000 evaluations/minute.
Spike 01 measured **≈1,610 evaluations/minute from a single process** — the whole target
from one worker.

The island model stays in the design for its *evolutionary* value: independent
subpopulations with migration is one of the [D004](#d004) diversity mitigations. But it is
no longer load-bearing for speed, so if it proves awkward to build, dropping to 2–4 workers
is now viable rather than fatal.

**Caveat:** the measurement excluded fluid forces, brain evaluation and collision. Re-measure
at Milestone 3.

---

### D012
**Living literature review, extended in rounds** · 2026-08-02

A PRISMA report is a snapshot by design. Appending papers to one silently falsifies its
counts and its self-assessment — §7.3's "small n" claim is a live statement, not decoration.

The review now carries a round table (§0) and a search update protocol (§3.5, which is
PRISMA-S item 12 and was originally omitted). Superseded claims are struck through rather
than deleted, mirroring [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md)'s draft changelogs.

---

### D013
**Public repository, named `cambrian`** · 2026-08-02

The Cambrian explosion was a rapid diversification of **body plans**, which is exactly what a
morphological archive exists to produce. It also hooks the literature — [U07], which drove
the largest correction to the design, analyses *Anomalocaris*, a Cambrian animal.

**Rejected:** `evolved-virtual-creatures` (discoverable but generic and long), `medusoid`
(wry, but names a limitation rather than an ambition), `evosim` (matches the namespaces,
but generic).

Public was made safe first: PDFs verified gitignored, no emails in tracked content, and the
institution name genericized to "university subscription access" — legitimate use, but a
personal detail of no value to a reader, and publishing personal information is much harder
to undo than adding it back.

---

### D014
**Papers and their extractions are never committed** · 2026-08-02

`research/papers/` holds copyrighted publisher PDFs plus machine extractions; two were
obtained through a university subscription. Converting a paywalled paper to markdown does
not make it redistributable.

[`research/FETCH-RESULTS.md`](research/FETCH-RESULTS.md) is tracked instead and records the
exact retrieval URL for every paper, so the set is reconstructible by anyone with equivalent
access.

Enforced by `.gitignore` **and** by [`scripts/githooks/pre-commit`](scripts/githooks/pre-commit),
because a gitignore rule is one careless `git add -f` away from being bypassed — and because
an over-broad ignore rule silently dropped Unity's `Packages/manifest.json` from the first
commit, which is the same class of failure in the opposite direction.

---

### D015
**MIT for code, CC BY 4.0 for documentation** · 2026-08-02

This repository is roughly 90% prose and 10% throwaway spike code. A single code licence
would have been the reflexive choice and the wrong one: MIT says nothing meaningful about a
literature review or a design specification, and the thing most likely to be reused here is
the written work.

CC BY 4.0's attribution requirement matches the norm the prose already follows — every
load-bearing claim in `DESIGN.md` carries a page-level locator, so asking the same of anyone
downstream is consistent rather than restrictive. Both licences are permissive; neither
imposes copyleft on anything built on top.

**Rejected:** MIT alone (silent on prose); Apache-2.0 (the patent grant is irrelevant to
evolutionary algorithms and adds a NOTICE obligation for nothing); CC BY-NC (looks
protective, but blocks academic reuse in commercially-funded research, which is most of it);
CC BY-SA (viral into anything quoting the review — a nuisance for the exact audience this is
written for).

`LICENSE-DOCS` references the canonical CC BY text at creativecommons.org rather than
reproducing it. Several thousand words transcribed from memory is a real risk of a subtly
wrong licence, and a wrong licence is worse than a link.

Neither licence covers the quoted paper excerpts, which stay their publishers' copyright
under fair dealing and are attributed at the point of use. See [D014].

### D016
**A logbook, kept as dated entries rather than assembled as a book** · 2026-08-02

The four existing documents all describe the system as it currently stands. None of them
records *process* — what was tried, what broke, what the numbers were on the day. That
material is perishable: the specifics that make it useful are gone within about a week, and
they are exactly what makes a failure instructive rather than embarrassing.

`logbook/` fills that gap. Entries are dated, written the day something happens, and never
edited to match a later reality — a superseded entry is superseded by a newer one, as in
this file.

**Considered and deferred:** writing a book alongside the work. Two objections. First, it
duplicates `DESIGN.md` in friendlier prose, and when the spec changes the book is silently
wrong — the failure mode `CLAUDE.md` exists to prevent, at the largest possible scale.
Second, committing to book shape before there is a working system claims an outcome the work
hasn't earned. If the entries later turn out to be chapter-shaped, they can be assembled
then; they cannot be reconstructed from memory.

The rule that makes it safe: **the logbook is never a source of truth.** It links to the
other documents for facts rather than restating them.

**Rejected names:** `notebook/` (collides with Jupyter), `journal/` (in a repo full of
citations, that word means a publication venue), `logs/` and `docs/` — the first is caught by
`[Ll]ogs/` in `.gitignore` and would have been silently untracked, the second implies
reference documentation, which the four existing documents already are.

### D017
**Endogenous selection: an energy economy instead of a fitness function** · 2026-08-02

The design through draft 4 was Sims-lineage directed search: evaluate a creature alone, score
it by displacement (§5.5), let the score drive MAP-Elites. Draft 5 replaces that with an
ecosystem. Energy is a conserved budget with sunlight as its only primary input; creatures
spend it on metabolism, thinking and mechanical work; they reproduce on surplus and die at
zero. Nothing is scored. Specification in DESIGN.md §5A.

**The argument.** The project was never about producing the best swimmer. If swimming is what
keeps a creature alive, swimmers appear without being asked for — and if something else
appears instead, that is the more interesting result, because it was not the answer to a
question we wrote down. Directed search can only return a better version of the thing the
fitness function already describes.

**Why energy acquisition is a property of a part.** Cell types (photosynthetic, absorptive,
consumer, structural) make trophic strategy a *morphological* trait, which means the §4.1
graph encoding already expresses it. No species, niche or strategy concept is needed: a
species is a distribution of part types, and speciation is a change in that distribution. This
is what makes the whole thing cost one new field on `MorphNode` rather than a new subsystem.

**What the literature says, honestly.** It splits, and one paper argues the opposite.
[C18 §2.4, p.8] optimises against energy and material and credits the energy term with
producing passive tissue that creatures then exploit hydrodynamically. But [CEA07 §3.4, p.5]
pays a *bonus* for complexity (k^N, k = 1.02) on the grounds that *"simpler creatures are
likely to evolve faster and gain speed earlier"* — complexity is slow to pay off and gets
out-competed before it can. Via [L21 §8.2, p.10], Cheney et al. found complexity penalties
*"drive morphological evolution, [but don't] influence the overall performance of the
algorithm."* And [TM01 p.7] argues against elaborate fitness functions in principle, since
creatures find ways to score highly *"while not performing the sort of behavior that we had
hoped for."*

The energy economy sidesteps that debate rather than settling it: cost is not a term subtracted
from a score, it is a budget that runs out. [L21 §13] reports two systems that work this way
(PolyWorld, Ventrella's Gene Pool). Neither is a rigorous result — they are described in a
survey, not evaluated — and this decision should not be read as literature-backed. It is a bet.

**What it is a bet on.** That a food web is more watchable than a highlight reel of champions,
and that endogenous selection produces something we did not specify. The risk is real and runs
the other way: directed search reliably produces spectacular swimmers, and open-ended systems
reliably produce plateaus. DESIGN.md §5A.7 lists the failure modes and what defends against
each; the load-bearing one is that if sunlight alone covers upkeep, the world becomes a
photosynthetic mat and nothing ever has to move.

**Why now rather than later.** Milestone 4 had not been built. Everything through Milestone 2
is unaffected because the encoding does not care how selection happens. After Milestone 4 this
would have discarded an island model, a selector, and a throughput target measured in a unit
that no longer applies.

**Supersedes:** DESIGN.md §5.5 entirely. Demotes §8's MAP-Elites from selector to observatory —
it existed to protect morphological innovation against premature convergence under exogenous
fitness (§2), and ecological niches serve that role here. It is retained because an archive of
what lived is what makes a long run legible, which is a cheaper claim than the one it used to
carry.

**Considered and rejected:** an energy cost as a term *inside* the fitness function. It fights
[CEA07]'s finding directly, taxing elaborate bodies before they have learned to use themselves —
the same direction as the premature-convergence failure that §2 is built to resist. An earlier
draft of this decision proposed energy as a MAP-Elites descriptor instead, following [CU15]'s
use of it as a behavioural descriptor rather than an objective; that remains the right answer
*if* directed search is ever restored, and is recorded here so it does not have to be
rediscovered.

**Deferred deliberately:** attack and defence mechanics, sexual reproduction, per-part density
(swim bladders). Each is a second system, and each should be designed against observed
behaviour rather than guessed before anything runs.
